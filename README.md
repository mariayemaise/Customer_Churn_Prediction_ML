# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready serialization. It uses various machine learning models to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of churn.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of classifiers including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Model Deployment**: Serialization of the trained model using `pickle` for future use.
